I"5<p>The distinct eight-sided front rooms of the Lion House sent us down an octagon-shaped rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Octagon houses were briefly popular in the 1850s in the US and Canada during the Victorian period. If you wanted to show off your individualistic flair and defy the constraints of four walls, you built an octagon. Octagons have eight 135 degree angled corners, just like the angles for a bay window, making the construction of an octagonal room a lot simpler than you might expect. The entrance to the Lion House is flanked by 2 octagonal rooms with the first floor having sixteen 135 degree corners and the second floor fourteen 135 degree corners. The builders of our house also hand made bricks with 135 corners.</p>

<p>The octagon strikes a great balance between a curved room and square room. Curved rooms offer natural light throughout most of the day and are more efficient to heat and cool. Theyâ€™re pretty tricky to build though and even trickier to furnish. The octagon approximates to a spherical shape, giving you access to more natural light throughout the day while providing straight walls that are easier to furnish.</p>

<p>I consider City Hall in University City the best example of the octagonal building in St. Louis.
