I"Ž<p>Weâ€™ve begun our research into the history of the Lion House as we embark on our historic renovation journey. We have to thank Dr. William G. Swekosky for his photo collection thatâ€™s available online in the St. Louis Public Library. Dr. Swekosky (1894 - 1963) took many photographs of old houses and buildings around St. Louis, many of which are now demolished. Weâ€™ve included a photograph of the man himself, looking quite dapper in his boater hat, to put a face to the efforts behind the documentation of St. Louis history. Thank you Dr. Swekosky!</p>

<p>The photographs we have available in his collection are from 1952. The first one shows the limestone portico at the front of the house. The entire thing was covered in a carved limestone. Above the front doors are what looks like a transom window with wrought iron works. From this picture we also realized all the trim around the roof line, between the first and second floors, and the windows are limestone. We definitely want to get rid of the current dark brown paint and show off the limestone again. The cuppola is also just totally blinging out, just check out that limestone cornice and slate roof! The second photograph is more of a direct view of the front of the house. I initially thought the roof would be slate but from the looks of this photo Iâ€™m not so sure. Our lion on the right is roaring! He currently has a bit of an awkward smile so we plan to bring him back to his full glory.</p>
