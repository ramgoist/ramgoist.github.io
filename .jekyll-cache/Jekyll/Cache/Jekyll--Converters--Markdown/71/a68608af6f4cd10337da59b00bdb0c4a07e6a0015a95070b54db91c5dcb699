I"2<p>We’ve begun our research into the history of the Lion House as we embark on our historic renovation journey. We have to thank Dr. William G. Swekosky for his photo collection that’s available online in the St. Louis Public Library. Dr. Swekosky (1894 - 1963) took many photographs of old houses and buildings around St. Louis, many of which are now demolished. We’ve included a photograph of the man himself, looking quite dapper in his boater hat, to put a face to the efforts behind the documentation of St. Louis history. Thank you Dr. Swekosky!</p>
