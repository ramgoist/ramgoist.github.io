I"t<p>Octagon houses were briefly popular in the 1850s in the US and Canada during the Victorian period. If you wanted to show off your individualistic flair and defy the constraints of four walls, you built an octagon. Octagons have eight 135 degree angled corners, just like the angles for a bay window, making the construction of an octagonal room was a lot simpler than one may think. The entrance to the Lion House is flanked by 2 octagonal rooms with the first floor having sixteen 135 degree corners and the second floor has fourteen 135 degree corners. The builders of our house also hand made bricks with 135 corners.</p>
